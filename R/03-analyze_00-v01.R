#' # Introduction
#'
#' In this project I investigate the results of Texas school UIL Academic competitions.
#'
#' ## Motivation
#'
#' Probably the main reason that I am interested in this subject is
#' because I myself competed in these competitions when I was in school!
#' I would like to know how I stacked up histogrically among all students.
#'
#' Additionaly, aside from standardized testing, these competitions might be the best way
#' of identifiing "strong" sutdents and schools. In fact, given the competitive
#' nature of this domain, one could argue that these competitions provide
#' better gauges of "elite" sutdents and schools. Thus, analysis of competition
#' results is useful for revealing highly reputable schools and spotlighting
#' superior students.
#'
#' Finally, as if I needed any other excuse to invesitgate this data,
#' I saw this data set as a great opportunity to practice my
#' `#rstats` and `#datascience` skills.
#'
#' ## Getting the Data
#'
#' ...
#'
#' ## About the Data
#'
#' First, before doing any kind of analysis, one should be aware of some "meta" details.
#'
#' The UIL categorizes schools into one of six "conferences". The conference labels
#' range from `1A`, `2A`, ..., `6A`, where the increasing leading digit (i.e. `1`, `2`, etc.)
#' generally corresponds to increasing school size. Schools only compete against
#' other schools in their conference.
#'
#' The UIL defines 3 levels of competition (in order of "difficulty"): `District`, `Region`, and `State`.
#' Winning a `District` competitions, results in a `Region` competition appearance,
#' and, subsequently, winning a `Region` competiton results in a `State` competition appearance.
#' (Keep in mind that schools still only compete against other schools in their same
#' conference, even as they advance.)
#' Note that The UIL identifies 32 total `District`s in Texas, which are aggregated into 4 `region`s.
#'
#' For schools, winning is a "winner-take-all" matter: only the school with the most combined points
#' among its individual competitors advances. On ther other hand, an individual
#' may advance even if his school does not win if he places among the top `n`.
#' (Note that $n$is dependent on the competition type. See the UIL rules for more details.).
#'
#'
#' There are 5 different competitions "types" in the data set:
#' `Calculator Applications`, `Computer Science`, `Mathematics`, `Number Sense`, and `Science`.
#' There are actually many more UIL competition types than those analyzed here
#' (including competitons for theatre, band, etc.), but these are the ones
#' for which I retrieved data.
