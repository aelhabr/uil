#'

#'
#' There's not too much to "learn" from this ranking by simple count of
#' number of competitions competed in.
#' All I can say is that I'm jealous of these people.
#'
#'
#' ### From which conferences do the individuals who competed the most come?
#'
#+ results = "hide"
num_top <- 1000
comps_stats_byperson_top <-

  slice(1:num_top)

#'
#'
#'
knitr::kable(comps_stats_byperson_top_byconf)

#'
#' What stands out here is that there doesn't seem to be as many individual
#' competitors in `6A`. I would hypothesize that this might because the `6A` conference
#' has the largest schools, which are more likely to "allocate sparingly" their individual
#' competitors among different competitions. (There is a limit on the number of entrants
#' per school in a given competition. Smaller schools are much less likely to ever
#' have enough people to reach the per-school limit, so individuals at these schools
#' are welcom to compete in as many competitions as they would like.)
#'
#' ### Which individuals were most "dominant"?
#'
#' To rank the most "dominant" competitors, I use the sum of the
#' percentile rank of placings in all competitions (i.e. `prank_sum`).
#'
#' I evaluated some other metrics for gauging individual
#' success, including total number
#' of individuals defeated in head-to-head competitions (i.e. `defeat_cnt_sum`),
#' `prank` and `defeat_cnt` attempt to measure the same underlying thing,
#' but I think `prank` is a little more "natural" to interpret because
#' it contextualizes number of competitors implicitly with its "unit" value between 0 and 1,
#' whereas `defeat_cnt` can be difficult to interpret directly because
#' the number of head-to-head to competitors is not defined implicitly by it.
#' I also examed the  "average" versions of `prank` and `defeat_cnt`
#' (i.e. `prank_sum` and `defeat_cnt_sum`), but I found that they were sensitive
#' to individuals who did not compete in many competitions, yet placed very well
#' in them. This is not how I quantify "domination".
#'
#' I use `prank_sum` (or some slight modification of it) as the primary choice for ranking individuals and
#' schools in other parts of my analysis. (Raw `score` is also used, although
#' it is "naive".)
